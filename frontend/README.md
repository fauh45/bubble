# bubble frontend

To start a development web server, do this,

1. Start backend (`../backend`) as the instruction shows
2. Create `.env` on the root of this project, with these required environment variables, where `REACT_APP_BACKEND` is the url to the backend. NOTE : Do not add the `/` at the end of the url.

`.env` Example
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND=http://localhost:3000
```

3. Start the web server using `yarn start`
